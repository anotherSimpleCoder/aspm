# aspm
ASPM - Another Simple Project Maker for C++

This is just a small automation I did, so that I don't have to create the same folders
and files over and over again.

-----------
# Installation:

For Linux:
	Besides the ASPM executable you will also find a file called "setup.sh". That
	file will install aspm to your machine and also lets you call aspm by just
	entering "aspm" in your terminal.

For Windows:
	Besides the ASPM executable you will also find a file called "setup.bat". That
	file will install aspm to your machine and also lets you call aspm by just entering
	"aspm" in your terminal.

---------

# Uninstallation:

For Linux:
	Besides the ASPM executable you will also find a file called "uninstall.sh". That
	file will uninstall aspm from your machine.

For Windows:
	Besides the ASPM executable you will also find a file called "uninstall.bat". That
	file will uninstall aspm from your machine.

Currently it's just available for C++, but feel free to contribute and enhance it for
other languages as well!

# aspm
ASPM - Another Simple Project Maker for C++

This is just a small automation I did, so that I don't have to create the same folders
and files over and over again.

-----------
#Installation:

For Linux and Mac:
	Besides the ASPM executable you will also find a file called "install.sh". That
	file will install aspm to your machine and also lets you call aspm by just
	entering "aspm" in your terminal.

For Windows:
	By the time you are reading this, I am working on a Windows installing script ;)

---------

Currently it's just available for C++, but feel free to contribute and enhance it for
other languages as well!
